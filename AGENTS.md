# Repository Guidelines

These instructions are intentionally task-agnostic. Every future effort in this repo should follow
the workflow hardening and coding conventions below to keep hand-offs simple and recoverable.

## Workflow Hardening
- **Planning trail**: For every task `T###`, scaffold `doc/ai/tasks/T###_<slug>/plan/README.md` (start from
  `doc/ai/templates/task_plan_README.template.md`) plus one subfolder per subtask (copy
  `doc/ai/templates/subtask_plan_README.template.md`). Each plan file needs objective, deliverables,
  flow, checklist, explicit “commit `T###/S###: short summary`” step, and a Feedback section updated at
  completion.
- **GitHub task issues**: Mirror every task in GitHub using `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml` as soon as
  the task branch is created. Apply the `task` label plus exactly one `status:*` label at a time
  (`status:proposed`, `status:active`, `status:blocked`, `status:needs-review`, `status:completed`).
  The issue stores the canonical scope/context; after creation, only update it for status changes or
  major scope shifts. Local docs must link to the issue instead of duplicating its prose.
- **Task PRs**: Immediately after opening the issue, create a draft PR from `task/T###_<slug>` to
  `development` via the MCP `github` server. The PR description must include “Closes #<issue>` plus a
  short scope summary. Keep the PR open throughout execution, push subtask commits to the task
  branch, and only merge once reviews/tests finish. Do **not** merge task branches locally into
  `development`; let the PR handle merges + issue auto-close.
- **Progress log mirroring**: Every Progress Log entry added to the plan must be duplicated as a
  comment on the task PR (queue it locally if offline, then post once connectivity returns) so
  reviewers can track live checkpoints without touching the issue.
- **Workflow cost check**: For any workflow/process change, jot a quick token-cost note. If the
  change nudges spend, verify the benefit; if it pushes ≥5% more tokens per task (or a higher tier),
  stop and get project-owner approval first. Log the analysis in the plan so the decision is
  traceable.
- **Estimate snapshot**: Every task + subtask plan must include the Estimate Snapshot block (token
  bucket XS/XL, complexity 1–5, ≤3 work-type tags, LLM tier recommendation, confidence, optional
  dependencies + risk hotspots). Update it whenever scope changes or projected usage jumps ≥1
  bucket (≈≥5% cost). If confidence drops to Low or bucket increases, call it out in the Progress
  Log + task PR comment before continuing.
- **Retro metrics**: Populate the plan’s Retro Metrics section within one session of finishing a
  task/subtask. Record the actual token bucket plus variance, token source + confidence,
  nearest-0.5h time spent (note calendar days if useful), estimate accuracy rating (On target /
  Under / Over), LLM tier actually used, and variance drivers/learnings. Escalate in the Progress Log
  + task PR if variance ≥1 bucket or confidence drops to Low.
- **GitHub operations via MCP**: Use the MCP `github` server for every interaction with GitHub—issues,
  labels, comments, file edits, pushes, merges, etc. Local `git push`, `git pull`, `gh ...`, or direct
  API calls are forbidden. If MCP access ever blocks a required action, pause and document it in the
  plan/PR instead of falling back to local tooling.
- **Checkpointing**: Update plan checklists immediately after any progress. A stopped laptop should
  only need the latest checklist state to resume.
- **Research logs**: When using MCP `brave-search` or `fetch`, capture URLs + summaries in the
  relevant subtask doc (or under `doc/ai/research/` if reused later). Avoid repeating lookups.
- **Documentation hygiene**: Do not paste chat/discussion transcripts into repository documents; summarize outcomes and
  link to sanitized logs instead.
- **Documentation scope**: Keep user-facing docs (e.g., root `README.md`) focused on product usage. Capture developer
  workflow/process details here in `AGENTS.md` or contributor guides, and reserve AI-only instructions for `doc/ai/**`
  so audiences stay separated.
- **Commits per subtask**: Finish each subtask with `T###/S###: short summary`, where `S###` is the
  zero-padded subtask index (use `S000` for task-level commits when no subtask exists). Never mix
  unrelated work in a single commit.
- **Python tooling**: Activate the repo venv (`source .venv/bin/activate`) whenever you need the
  `python` command; the commit hook depends on `.venv/bin/python` being available.
- **Commit lint hook**: Run `git config core.hooksPath githooks` once per clone to enable the tracked
  `commit-msg` hook. It calls `devtools/check_commit_message.py` (via `.venv/bin/python`) to block
  subjects that do not match `T###/S###: short summary`.
- **Status visibility**: Keep a progress log in the root plan so new agents can inspect the latest
  timestamp and continue confidently.
- **Task catalog**: Number tasks as `T###` (e.g., `T001`) and track them under
  `doc/ai/tasks/README.md`. Each task owns a folder `doc/ai/tasks/T###_<slug>/` whose `README.md`
  holds the canonical brief and links to the GitHub issue. Mark exactly one row as **Active** and
  ensure it matches the GitHub issue’s `status:active` label. Every task doc (and each subtask file)
  needs a Feedback section with open problems, outstanding questions, and learnings for future
  sessions plus a link back to the GitHub issue.

### Branch Workflow (Tasks & Subtasks)
1. **Start from `development`**: Before creating a task branch, run `git checkout development` and
   `git pull --ff-only origin development` so you branch from the latest tip.
2. **Task branch naming & remote tracking**: Create exactly one branch per active task named
   `task/T###_<slug>` (slug matches the task folder) and push it immediately via the MCP `github`
   server (`task/T###_<slug>` vs. `development`). All subsequent pushes for that branch also go
   through MCP.
3. **Issue + draft PR**: Right after the branch exists, open the GitHub issue (if not already) and a
   draft PR from `task/T###_<slug>`→`development` with “Closes #<issue>` in the body. The PR stays
   open/draft until tests + reviews finish; no direct merges into `development`.
4. **Subtask branches**: For each subtask, branch from the task branch tip using
   `subtask/T###_S#_<slug>` (example: `subtask/T004_S1_branch-policy`). Push new subtask branches via
   MCP on creation so remote history mirrors the plan log.
5. **Subtask integration**: When a subtask passes its checklist/tests, merge its branch back into the
   task branch locally using `git merge --no-ff subtask/...` (still on the task branch), resolve any
   conflicts, then push the updated task branch via MCP. Never merge the task branch into
   `development` locally.
6. **Push cadence**: Push after creation, after every meaningful checkpoint (tests run, major edits),
   and before ending a session. If you cannot push (offline), record the reason + next steps in the
   task plan progress log and the PR comment, then push as soon as connectivity returns.
7. **PR review & merge**: All task-level merges happen via the GitHub PR. Once reviewers approve and
   required checks pass, merge the PR (allowing GitHub to fast-forward or create the merge commit) so
   the issue auto-closes. Only after the PR merge should you delete task/subtask branches (local+remote).
8. **Force pushes**: `git push --force*` is forbidden on `development` and task branches. It remains
   allowed on an unpublished subtask branch only to fix mistakes before hand-off or to excise
   sensitive data, and the plan’s Feedback section must record the reason.
9. **Session hand-off**: Before ending a session (or pausing a task), ensure the task branch is
   pushed, leave the latest checkpoint in the plan + PR comment, and note any pending actions. You no
   longer need to merge back to `development` for hand-off.

### Planning Templates
- Task-level plan template: `doc/ai/templates/task_plan_README.template.md`
- Subtask plan template: `doc/ai/templates/subtask_plan_README.template.md`
- Always copy these templates when creating new task or subtask plan files and keep the commit +
  feedback checklist items intact.
- The templates include a "GitHub Issue" section—populate it with the issue URL, current
  `status:*` label, and sync expectations so anyone reviewing the plan can jump straight to the
  canonical tracker.

## Project Structure & Ownership
- Each `doc/ai/tasks/T###_<slug>/plan/` folder captures planning artifacts; never delete history—append
  timestamped entries so other agents can replay decisions.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Shell scripts: include `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, enable `set -euo pipefail`, keep indentation
  consistent, and lint with the tools your team trusts.
- Config/build definitions: declare configurable arguments near the top, comment extension points,
  and avoid environment-specific assumptions so files stay portable.
- Structured data (HCL/JSON/YAML): stick to consistent casing (e.g., snake_case for variables,
  kebab-case for targets) and document non-obvious fields inline.
- Markdown: use title case headings, wrap lines around 100 chars for diffs, and favor tables for
  matrix-style data.

## Testing Guidelines
- Provide lightweight smoke tests that prove the primary containers/CLIs/agents boot correctly.
- Name tests `test_<feature>` (or similar) and cover dependency checks in addition to happy-path
  flows.
- Run the full suite regularly (at least weekly) so regressions surface before release work.

## Commit, PR, and Review Expectations
- Commit subject format: `T###/S###: short summary` (≤72 chars). Example: `T004/S001: Add branch
  workflow policy`. `S###` is zero-padded (`S001`, `S002`, …); use `S000` for task-wide commits if no
  subtask applies.
- Use `.venv/bin/python devtools/check_commit_message.py --message "T123/S045: Example"` (or pass a
  commit message file) to lint manually; the `githooks/commit-msg` hook runs the same script
  automatically.
- PRs open as drafts when the task branch is created. The description must include “Closes #<issue>`,
  affected matrix slices, commands executed, and links to governing tasks/plan docs. Update the PR
  body whenever scope changes so reviewers never have to chase context. Include logs or screenshots
  only when diagnosing failures.
- Cross-reference planning docs (`doc/ai/tasks/T###_<slug>/plan/*.md`) whenever scope changes so
  reviewers can trace intent quickly.
- All merges into `development` happen through the GitHub PR (no local merges). After the PR merges
  cleanly and the issue auto-closes, delete task/subtask branches locally + remotely and record the
  merge in the plan progress log.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Keep secrets (registry tokens, SSH keys, API keys) out of source control; rely on environment
  variables or CI secrets managers instead.
- Pin external dependencies (containers, packages, APIs) to known-good versions and revisit them
  regularly for security advisories.
- Document telemetry defaults and opt-out steps directly in build scripts or READMEs so adopters can
  disable unexpected reporting.
